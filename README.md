#### As beautiful as a shell


> Summary: The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. Yes, your little bash or zsh. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors

##### Q - So what is a shell?
As the subject cites : ` The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all coders agreed
that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously
irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with
a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close
to english.
With Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems
people faced when Windows didn’t exist.` 

So, basically, a shell is simply a program which simplicify the task of communicating between a user and a machine (Oh yes, it does translate the communication between users and the kernel.), `Finder` on `MAC` and programs like `nautils` on `Linux` or better sazing `GNU/Linux` are other examples of shell.
